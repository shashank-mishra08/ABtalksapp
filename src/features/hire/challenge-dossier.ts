 * of graded missions, a graded project and an exit interview; a challenge
 * participant is measured against 60 days of daily submissions, each one carrying
 * a GitHub URL the platform recorded at the time. Neither has to be translated
 * into the other — the dossier carries a provenance per field, and the coverage
 * it returns says which dimensions this track can produce at all.
 *
 * Given name is loaded for the card. Email, phone, college, GitHub handle,
 * LinkedIn URL, and submission URLs stay off the dossier. `links` reports that
