/**
 * Candidate review panel — T-239 / TC-R-007. Run with:
 *   npm run test:review-panel
 *
 * No network, no database, no DOM. Two halves: the resize maths and the
 * next/previous contract are exercised directly, and the wiring that only
 * exists in JSX and CSS is held in place by source assertions — the same
 * approach as `project-state.test.ts`, because this repo has no DOM runner.
