/**
 * One loader per track, behind one signature.
 *
 * `searchCandidates` used to branch on four hardcoded booleans —
 * `wantProgram / wantClaude / wantSixty / wantHackathon` — each with its own
 * builder, its own return type and its own normalisation. A fifth track could be
 * named by the agent and then matched nothing, because nothing here knew how to
 * load it. This is the seam that makes a new descriptor actually return cards.
 *
 * The three builders genuinely differ — different tables, different arguments,
 * different shapes — so unifying them means an adapter each. That work is here
 * rather than in the search, and the merge that follows it is pure and tested.
 */

/**
 * Persist only sources the Prisma enum already knows.
 *
 * `TalentRequestMatch.source` and `TalentEngagementRequest.source` are
 * `TalentCandidateSource` (PROGRAM, CHALLENGE_60, CLAUDE, HACKATHON, PROFILE).
 * A track can be described, filtered, searched and ranked from the registry,
 * but its matches cannot be WRITTEN until that enum includes the slug — which
 * is a migration (PROFILE landed in plan 117).
 *
 * This narrows explicitly and returns null rather than casting, so an unknown
 * slug surfaces as a logged, handled case at the two write sites instead of a
 * runtime Prisma error a recruiter would meet as a failed intro request.
