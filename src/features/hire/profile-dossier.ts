/**
 * Candidates who are searchable because their PROFILE is usable — and for no
 * other reason.
 *
 * This is the track that makes discoverability derive from profile state alone.
 * Everyone here has zero ABTalks activity by construction: no cohort, no
 * challenge, no hackathon, no missions, no interview. That is not a defect to
 * be papered over, so every evidence figure below is an honest zero rather than
 * an invented one, and `provenance` marks the profile facts `declared` — they
 * are the candidate's word, and the card must not imply otherwise.
 *
 * Consequences that are deliberate:
 *   - `computeCoverage` will report almost every dimension false for a
 *     profile-only pool, which is exactly right: there is nothing to rank on but
 *     the declared stack, and the recruiter should be told that.
 *   - the evidence floor is never consulted here. It ranks and counts elsewhere;
 *     it has never been an eligibility condition and must not become one.
