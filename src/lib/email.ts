/**
 * Transactional mail, through Brevo.
 *
 * This used to call Resend, and nothing that reaches it ever sent: `RESEND_API_KEY`
 * is not configured anywhere, so every caller was quietly taking the
 * `skipped: true` branch. That is five paths, three of them recruiter-facing —
 * the sign-in code, the admin's approval mail and the hire alert — plus the
 * contact form and DSAR notifications. In development the recruiter one hides
 * behind `otpDevFallbackEnabled`, which prints the code to the log instead, so
 * the failure only showed up in production, where nobody could sign in and
 * nothing said why.
 *
 * Brevo is the provider this project actually has credentials for and already
 * uses for the workshop, hackathon and challenge-reset mail. One provider
 * beats two, and beats one that is only configured on paper.
 *
 * ## T-259
 *
 * This is the single choke point for outbound mail, so it is where the
 * notification bridge lives: every call allocates a `deliveryId`, writes a
 * `OutboundDelivery` row, emits `notification.attempt` / `.sent` /
 * `.skipped` / `.failed`, and reports failures to Sentry tagged with that same
 * id. The recipient address never reaches a log line or a Sentry payload —
 * only its SHA-256.
 *
 * The result shape only gained fields, so no caller had to move.
