/*
 * What the recruiter has typed so far, and where it goes.
 *
 * Nothing here is written to the server. The account fields reach
 * `registerRecruiterWithOtpAction` on the Verify step (or
 * `registerRecruiterAction` when a session already proves the address); the
 * optional company fields reach `updateRecruiterProfileAction` once the
 * recruiter is signed in.
 *
 * The draft lives in localStorage, on the device, for at most DRAFT_TTL_MS. It
 * used to live in sessionStorage, which was wrong for this flow rather than
 * merely conservative: Verify emails a 6-digit code, so leaving the tab is a
 * REQUIRED step, and on a phone that tab is routinely evicted — a code tapped
 * from the mail app opens a new one either way. The recruiter came back to a
 * blank welcome card and retyped all seven fields. Worse, `registered` was the
 * only record that the account already existed, so losing it turned a missed
 * sign-in into a full second pass that ended at "already registered".
 *
 * It holds a name and a work email, so: device-only, never sent to the server,
 * expired after a week, cleared the moment onboarding finishes — and it never
 * holds a code or a password.
