/**
 * Does the mobile bottom nav belong on this route?
 *
 * One predicate, two callers: `BottomNav` asks it whether to render, and
 * `MainShell` asks it whether to reserve `pb-16` for it. They used to keep
 * separate hand-maintained lists of the same routes, which drifted — some
 * pages showed the bar *over* their own navigation, others reserved 64px for
 * a bar that never appeared. Asking one function makes disagreement
 * impossible.
 *
 * **The rule:** the bar is the navigation of last resort. It renders only
 * where nothing else navigates. A page hides it by having its own chrome —
 * `DashboardShell`'s side panel, `AdminMobileNav`, the recruiter portal, the
 * workshop shell — not by being remembered in a list.
 *
 * Adding a page with a side panel? Add it here, or it gets two navigations.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free on purpose: both callers are Client Components,
 * and this is exhaustively testable without rendering anything.
 */

/**
 * Pages that render `DashboardShell`, which carries the side panel.
 *
 * Kept as data rather than prose because it is checked against the actual
 * `DashboardShell` consumers: every page importing it must appear here.
